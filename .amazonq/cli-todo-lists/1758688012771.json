Found existing automata implementations in automata-theory-project/src/automata/ including DFA, NFA, TM, and PDA (partially implemented). Also found test files and project structure. The main project appears to be in the automata-theory-project subdirectory.","Fixed PDA implementation. The issue was with stack operations - the stack top should be the last element, and when pushing multiple symbols, they need to be reversed to maintain proper stack semantics. PDA now correctly handles balanced parentheses and other test cases."],"modified_files":["/Users/owner/lectures/automata-logic-intelligence/automata-theory-project/src/automata/pda.py"],"id":"1758688012771"}
