# Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFST) Concepts

## Connection to Automata Theory

WFSTs extend finite automata with:
- Output symbols (transduction)
- Weights on transitions
- Applications in NLP and speech recognition

## Key Concepts

- **Transduction**: Input-to-output mapping
- **Weights**: Probabilities or costs
- **Composition**: Combining transducers

## Applications

- Speech recognition
- Machine translation
- Text processing pipelines
