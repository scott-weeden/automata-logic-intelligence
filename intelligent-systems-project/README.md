# Intelligent Systems Project

## Overview
This project implements core artificial intelligence algorithms including search strategies, game playing, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and reinforcement learning. Based on CS 5368: Intelligent Systems coursework.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Core algorithm implementations
- `applications/` - Real-world AI applications and demos
- `notebooks/` - Educational Jupyter notebooks
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suites
- `templates/` - Student assignment templates
- `docs/` - API documentation and guides

## Key Components

### Search Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS) 
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search with heuristics

### Game Playing
- Minimax algorithm
- Alpha-Beta pruning
- Game state representation

### Decision Making
- Markov Decision Processes
- Value iteration
- Policy iteration
- Q-Learning and TD Learning

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
See individual module documentation and notebooks for detailed examples.
